# Python Ping Pong Game

A classic two-player Ping Pong game built with Python using the `turtle` graphics library. This project was built as a practice project to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python.

---

## How to Install & Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Windows OS *(required for `winsound` sound effects)*

### Steps

1. **Clone or download** this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_pingpong_game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate** into the project folder
   ```bash
   cd Python_pingpong_game
   ```

3. **Run** the game
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

> No external packages are needed. The game uses only Python's built-in `turtle` and `winsound` libraries.

## How to Play / Controls

The game is **Player vs AI**. Player 1 controls the left paddle manually while Player 2 is controlled by the computer.

| Player | Action | Key |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Player A (Left) | Move Up | `W` |
| Player A (Left) | Move Down | `S` |
| Player B (Right) | Controlled by AI | — |

### Rules
- The ball bounces off the **top and bottom** walls
- If the ball passes the **right wall**, **Player A** scores a point
- If the ball passes the **left wall**, **Player B** scores a point
- The score is displayed at the **top of the screen**

### File Descriptions

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `main.py` | Sets up the window, creates all objects, runs the game loop, handles scoring and collisions |
| `ball.py` | Defines the `Ball` class with position and movement methods |
| `paddle.py` | Defines the `Paddle` class with move up/down methods and position getter |

## OOP Design

This project applies core **Object-Oriented Programming** principles:

### Classes

#### `Ball` — `ball.py`
Represents the game ball.

| Attribute / Method | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `self.dx` / `self.dy` | Ball speed in x and y direction |
| `xcor()` | Returns current x position |
| `ycor()` | Returns current y position |
| `setx(x)` | Sets x position |
| `sety(y)` | Sets y position |
| `goto(x, y)` | Moves ball to a position (used on reset) |

#### `Paddle` — `paddle.py`
Represents a paddle (used for both Player A and AI).

| Attribute / Method | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `__init__(x)` | Creates a paddle at the given x position |
| `move_up()` | Moves the paddle up by 20 units |
| `move_down()` | Moves the paddle down by 20 units |
| `ycor()` | Returns current y position (used for collision detection) |

### OOP Principles Applied

| Principle | How it's used |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Encapsulation** | `Ball` and `Paddle` hide their internal `turtle.Turtle()` object — outside code only calls the class methods |
| **Abstraction** | `main.py` doesn't need to know how the ball or paddle draws itself — it just calls `move_up()`, `setx()`, etc. |
| **Reusability** | The same `Paddle` class is used for both Player A (`Paddle(-350)`) and the AI (`Paddle(350)`) |
